# tic-tac-toe

**Description:** This is a tik-tac-toe game made with React. This was an exercise where we walked through how to write a game with a React app, how to use React hooks to track state, and how to pass information/functions from parent components to child components and vice versa. This is the end state after the lectures.

**Instructions on how to run the app:**  
To run this app you can download the following files in this repository: index.html & tiktac.js. Save them locally. Then use node to run whatever local host you have set up.
